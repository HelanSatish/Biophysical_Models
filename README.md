# Biophysical_Models (Physiological Models)
Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model is a mathemetical description given by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in 1952. This is a mathematical model that represents the formation of electrical activity in neurons. This model is a set of nonlinear differential equations that approximates the electrical characteristics of neurons of squid giant axon. They received Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work in the year 1963. This code implements the Hodgkin Huxley model for different applied excitations (stimulus current).
